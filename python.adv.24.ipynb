    "Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python. The goal of importing the same module multiple times can vary depending on the specific use case. Here are a few situations where it might be beneficial:\n",

    "\n",
    "module.some_function()\n",
    "submodule.some_other_function()\n",
    "Modifying module behavior with reload: In some cases, you may want to modify the behavior of a module during runtime by reloading it after making changes to its source code. Importing the module multiple times allows you to reload it using the importlib.reload() function. This can be useful during development or in interactive sessions when experimenting with module modifications.\n",

    "Aliasing for readability or avoiding naming conflicts: Importing the same module with different aliases can improve code readability or help avoid naming conflicts when working with multiple modules that have similar names.

    "One characteristic of a module is that it can define functions, classes, variables, and other objects that can be accessed and utilized by other parts of the program. By using modules, developers can modularize their codebase and promote code reusability. This helps in maintaining clean and organized code by separating functionality into logical units.\n",

    "For example, a module named \"math_operations.py\" could contain functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These functions can be imported into other Python scripts or programs to perform mathematical operations without having to rewrite the code for each use case. The module encapsulates the math-related functionality, making it easily accessible and reusable throughout the program.\n",

    "Restructure the code: Analyze the interdependencies between the modules and restructure the code to remove the circular dependency. This may involve extracting common functionality into a separate module or introducing an intermediate module to mediate the interaction between the two modules.\n",

    "Dependency injection: Instead of directly importing and relying on the other module, you can pass the required dependencies as parameters to functions or constructors. This approach decouples the modules and allows you to create instances without explicit imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use local imports: If only specific functions or classes from a module are needed in another module, you can import them locally within the functions or methods where they are used. This way, the circular dependency is avoided at the module level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting modules: If the circular dependency is a result of two modules being tightly coupled, consider splitting them into smaller, more focused modules. This can help to reduce the dependency between modules and make the codebase more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactor shared code: If both modules require access to common functionality, consider refactoring that shared code into a separate module that can be imported by both modules. This way, the circular dependency can be eliminated, and the shared code can be accessed independently."
